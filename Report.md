# The Battle of Neighborhoods Part-1

## 1. Introduction/Business Problem
This study aims to help in appropriate selection of a location, for those who are planning on opening a new restaurant in Toronto. Additionally, this study will provide data on the population and income of each neighborhood as well as the competitors already present in the same regions.

## 2. Data and Data Source
For this section, the data regarding population, income, and possible competitors for each neighbourhood will be extracted by combining Toronto's 2016 Census with Foursquare API. The data sources used in this study are provided below: 

Toronto's 2016 Census: https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#8c732154-5012-9afe-d0cd-ba3ffc813d5a

## 3. Methodology 
For this section, different maps were compared, which could help new investors decide the best neighborhoods, in Toronto, to open their restaurant based on it's income, population and available competitors. To complete this task, the 2016 Census information, combined with choropleth maps and Foursquare data, were used to visually display the wealthier and more populous neighborhoods and the current restaurants in each region.

## 4. Results
Comparing the maps we can notice the majority of the restaurants grouped on main streets and on the south of the city, although some of the welthiest neighborhoods are up to the north. Additionally, the areas with a dense population don't reflect on the number of restaurants.

## 5. Discussion
One of the main observations that was noticed during this study was the lack of clusters of restaurants in certain regions.

## 6. Conclusion
This report may be helpful for someone planning on opening a restaurant in Toronto, by comparing the current offers and neighborhoods profiles, however it may not cover all variables such as access to public transportation or even the restaurants profiles, so it shall not be used as a single decision making tool.
